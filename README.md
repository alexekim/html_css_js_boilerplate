# html_css_js_boilerplate
A starting place for any front end project!

## Technologies used

* where and how it was used
* biggest achievement for you
* toughest problem you encountered

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, developer tools
* HTML: set up the foundation for the webpage. the skeleton
* CSS: while we didn't write up any css yet, we reviewed the cascading nature of it and how different elements will take priority over others. and also what to avoid
* JavaScript was used to show how we should set the order of elements that the browser will load. javascript should be set to load after html/css so that it won't act on things that do not yet exist
* developer tools let us perform a biopsy into the entire project and see how different elements were acting and affect each other

* biggest achievement was recovering from a few mistakes in terminal/github
* i did a few things incorrectly in terminal, but was able to recover. (somehow, but it works!)
